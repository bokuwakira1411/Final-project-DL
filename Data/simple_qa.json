We then use the `replace()` method with a regular expression `/\\s/g` to match all whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) in the string and replace them with an empty string `\"\"`.

The particle filter works by representing the possible locations of a device as a set of particles, each with a weight representing the likelihood that the device is at that location. The weights of the particles are then updated based on the measurements of the environment, and the particles are resampled to produce a new set of particles that better represent the current state of the device. This process is repeated over time to provide an estimate of the device's location that is more accurate than a single measurement."

    "output": "An oak tree typically grows the fastest during its early years of life, especially during the first 10 to 20 years. During this time, it can grow up to several feet per year. The growth rate of the oak tree slows down as it reaches maturity, which can take several decades, and eventually, it may only grow a few inches per year.\n\nThe growth rate of an oak tree can also vary depending on factors such as climate, soil conditions, availability of water and nutrients, and the particular species of oak tree. In general, oak trees grow best in areas with plenty of sunlight, adequate rainfall, and well-draining soil that is rich in nutrients."

If you then flip the coin an additional 10 times and it lands on heads 8 times, the relative frequency of heads is now 13/20, or 65%.\n\nRelative frequency is a useful tool for understanding the probability of an event occurring. In the coin flipping example, the relative frequency of heads gets closer to 50% as the number of flips increases, which suggests that the probability of the coin landing on heads is close to 50%."

    "input": "Solid State Relay definition",
    "output": "A Solid State Relay (SSR) is an electronic switching device that uses semiconductor devices to switch and control an electrical load, such as a lamp or a heater, without any moving parts. Unlike electromechanical relays that use mechanical contacts to switch the load, SSRs use optocouplers, photodiodes, and power transistors or thyristors to provide isolation between the control input and the load output.\n\nSSRs are often used in industrial applications where high reliability and long-term operation are required. They have several advantages over mechanical relays, such as faster switching times, higher switching frequencies, lower power consumption, and longer lifespan due to the absence of mechanical parts.\n\nSSRs are available in various configurations, such as single-phase or three-phase, AC or DC switching, and various load voltage and current ratings. They can be controlled by digital signals, such as TTL or CMOS, or by analog signals, such as 4-20mA or 0-10V."
