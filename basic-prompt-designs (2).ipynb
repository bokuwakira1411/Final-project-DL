She works overtime which means she makes $18.00 * 1 / 2 = $8.00 more. She makes $18.00 + $8.00 = $30.00 per day. She makes $30.00 * 5 = $300.00. The final answer: 300.\nShe makes $18.00 an hour, so she makes 1 * 18 = $38.00 per day. She works 10 hours every day, so she makes 10 * 5 = 50 hours. Overtime pays her 1 / 2 * 18 = $6.00 per hour. So she makes 18 + 6 = $28.00 per day. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, she makes 28 * 5 = $180.00. The answer: 180.\nFirst find the total amount of overtime she earns: $18.00 / hour * 10 hours / day * 5 days / week = $54.00. Then subtract that amount from her hourly wage to find how much she makes per day: $18.00 / hour - $54.00 = $38.00. Then multiply her hourly wage by the number of days per week to find her weekly earnings: $38.00 / week * 5 days / week = $180.00. Then subtract her weekly earnings from her hourly wage to find her weekly earnings: $180.00 - $380.00 = $90.00. The final answer: 90.\nShe works 10 hours every day, so she earns overtime every day for 10 * .5 = 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $18.00, so she is paid $18 * 3 = $63.00 for her 3 hours. She earns $63.00 + $18.00 = $78.00. She works 10 hours every day for 5 days, so she earns 78 * 5 = $330. The final answer: 330.\nShe works 10 hours a day for 5 days so she makes 10 * 5 = 50 hours.

Bobbie’s last name is 2 letters longer than Jamie’s. So if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have 2 - 2 = 1 letter. So Bobbie’s last name is 2 + 1 = 3 letters long. Therefore, Samantha’s last name has 3 - 2 = 1 letter. The answer: 1.\nIf Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. If Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey, then Bobbie’s last name would be twice the length of Jamie’s / Jamie’s name * 2 = Jamie Grey. Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, meaning that it has 3 - 4 = 1 letter. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s / Jamie’s name * 2 = Jamie Grey. Samantha’s last name has 1 letter, so it has 1 - 3 = 2\nIf Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s, Jamie Grey.

The total number of bananas in the remaining piles of 12 hands is 10 * 12 = 120 bananas. The total number of bananas in the 6 piles of 9 hands is 63 * 9 = 63 bananas. The total number of bananas in the remaining piles of 12 hands is 120 * 12 = 720 bananas. The total number of bananas in the 6 piles of 9 hands is 63 * 9 = 63 bananas. The total number of bananas in the 6 piles of 12 hands is 63 * 12 = 63 bananas. The total number\nThere were a total of 6 x 9 = 54 hands in the 6 piles of bananas. So, there were a total of 54 x 9 = 528 bananas in the 6 piles of bananas. There were a total of 10 - 6 = 4 piles of bananas. So, there were 4 x 12 = 48 hands in the remaining piles of bananas. So, there were a total of 48 x 12 = 448 bananas in the remaining piles of bananas. Therefore, there were a total of 528 + 448 = 988 bananas in the 10 piles of bananas. Therefore, each monkey would get 988 /\nSince there were 9 hands on 6 piles, and each hand had 14 bananas, there were a total of 6 * 9 = 54 bananas on 6 piles. There were 12 * 12 = 96 bananas on the remaining piles. The total number of bananas in all the piles is 54 + 96 = 116 bananas. If they divided the 116 bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 116 / 12 = 4.8 bananas. The answer: 4.8.\nFirst find the total number of hands in the 6 piles of 9 bananas: 6 hands * 9 bananas / hand = 54 bananas. Then find the total number of hands in the remaining 6 piles of 9 bananas: 6 hands * 12 bananas / hand = 96 bananas. Then add the number of hands in each pile to find the total number of bananas: 54 bananas + 96 bananas = 158 bananas. Then divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find the number of bananas each gets: 158 bananas / 12 monkeys = 3 bananas / monkey. The final answer: 3.\nThere are a total of 6 piles * 9 hands / hand = 54 hands. There are a total of 10 piles * 12 hands / hand = 120 hands. There are a total of 54 hands * 9 hands / hand = 336 hands. Thus, there are a total of 336 hands + 336 hands = 365 hands.

So the final answer is 84.\nTarget:  990\nInference:  She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $<<8*18=144.00>>144.00 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $<<18*.5=9.00>>9.00\nHer overtime pay is 18+9 = $<<18+9=27.00>>27.00\nHer base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720.00>>720.00\nHer overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $<<27*2=54.00>>54.00 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990.00>>990.00\n#### 990\nAnswer:  45.00\nInference:  She works 10 hours every day for 5 days for a total of 10 * 5 = 50 hours. She makes $18.00 an hour and she is eligible for overtime, so she makes $32.00 per day. Overtime is paid at your hourly wage + 1 / 2 * $18, so her overtime is $32.50 + $9.50 = $45.00.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mKeyboardInterrupt\u001b[0m

She will eat 12 * 4 = 48 eggs in 4 weeks. So, she will eat 48 / 12 = 2 dozens of eggs. Therefore, the final answer is 2.\nChain of Thought: She will eat 3 * 4 = 12 eggs a week. So, she will eat 12 * 4 = 48 eggs in a week. So, she will eat 48 / 12 = 4 dozens of eggs in a week. Therefore, the final answer is 4.\nChain of Thought: She eats 3 eggs per morning, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week. In 4 weeks, she eats 21 * 4 = 84 eggs. She eats a dozen, so she eats 84 / 12 = 3 dozens. The final answer: 3.\nSelf-Consistent Answer: 3\nAll votes: Counter({'3': 2, '96': 1, '2': 1, '4': 1})\n7\nChain of Thought: She has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles. So she still has 12 miles - 6 miles = 4 miles to walk. She needs to walk at 4 miles / hour * 4 hours = 16 miles per hour. So the final answer is 16.\nChain of Thought: Marissa's total distance to walk is 12 - 4 = 8 miles. Her total time walking is 1 + 1 = 2 hours. Thus, Marissa has to walk at an average speed of 8 / 2 = 4 miles per hour to walk the remaining 8 miles. The final answer: 4.\nChain of Thought: Marissa has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. She still has 12 - 6 = 4 miles to go. Her average speed is 4 miles per hour, so she needs to walk at 4 * 4 = 16 miles per hour. The final answer: 16.\nChain of Thought: Marissa has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles. She needs to walk 12 miles - 6 miles = 4 miles. Since her average speed is 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk 4 miles per hour x 4 hours = 16 miles per hour. The final answer: 16.\nChain of Thought: Since she walked 4 miles in one hour and 2 miles in the next hour, she has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. Since her goal is to walk 12 miles at 4 miles per hour, she still has 12 - 6 = 4 miles to go. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk at 4 * 4 = 16 miles per hour.

Here's an example:\n```java\nint[] arr = {4, 2, 7, 1, 3};\n\nArrays.sort(arr);\n\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));\n```\nOutput:\n```csharp\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 7]\n```\nIn the above example, we first initialize an integer array `arr` with some values. Then we call the `Arrays.sort()` method and pass the `arr` array as an argument. This method sorts the array in ascending order. Finally, we print the sorted array using the `Arrays.toString()` method.\n\nIf you want to sort the array in descending order, you can use the `Arrays.sort()` method with a custom comparator:\n```java\nint[] arr = {4, 2, 7, 1, 3};\n\nArrays.sort(arr, Collections.reverseOrder());\n\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));\n```\nOutput:\n```csharp\n[7, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\nIn this example, we pass the `Collections.reverseOrder()` method as a second argument to the `Arrays.sort()` method.

For example, if you are writing a struct in a language other than rust, you would use a borrowed type. So the answer is yes.\nTarget:  A struct in Rust can include borrowed types, such as references, when the struct needs to refer to the borrowed data but does not need to take ownership of it. For example, if a struct represents a configuration that should be read from a file, the struct can include a reference to the file path rather than storing the path as a string within the struct. This allows the struct to refer to the file without taking ownership of it, which can be useful if the file is being used by other parts of the program.

So the answer is yes.\nTarget:  A generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible framework for modeling various types of data, including continuous, binary, and count data. It is an extension of traditional linear regression, which is limited to modeling continuous data. GLM allows for the modeling of non-normal data by specifying a probability distribution for the response variable and a linear relationship for the predictors. The basic components of a GLM are a random component, which is modeled by a probability distribution, and a systematic component, which is modeled by a linear predictor. The linear predictor is a linear combination of the predictors and a set of parameters, which are estimated from the data. The probability distribution is determined by the type of response variable, such as normal, binomial, or Poisson. The GLM can be used to model a wide range of data types and can be used for both estimation and hypothesis testing.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"05e26b4ee73e4fa3a8bc79214c702d7f"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"f97158ade6334159ae025390d5aa7827"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"0.8172355890274048\nAnswer:  Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum mechanics.\nTarget:  Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data.

In contrast to classical computers, which use bits to store and process information, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits. Because qubits can be in multiple states at once, quantum computers are able to perform many calculations simultaneously, which can make them much faster than classical computers for certain types of problems. While quantum computers are still in the early stages of development, they have the potential to revolutionize many fields, including cryptography, medicine, and materials science.\n\nQ: why shouldn't I trust birds?,\nA: There is no reason not to trust birds in general. However, wild birds may carry diseases and it's best to avoid handling them or coming into contact with their droppings. Also, some bird species, such as pigeons, can carry diseases such as histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. So it's better to take precautions when interacting with wild birds.\n\nQ: I have an array of DomElements in JS, how can I find the item with the largest height?\nA: You can loop through the array of DomElements, and for each element, use the `offsetHeight` property to get its height. You can then compare this height to the current maximum height found so far and update the maximum height and corresponding DomElement accordingly. Here's an example implementation:\n```javascript\nfunction findMaxHeightElement(elements) {{\n  let maxHeight = -Infinity;\n  let maxHeightElement = null;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {{\n    const elementHeight = elements[i].offsetHeight;\n    if (elementHeight > maxHeight) {{\n      maxHeight = elementHeight;\n      maxHeightElement = elements[i];\n    }}\n  }}\n\n  return maxHeightElement;\n}}\nQ: {text['input']}\nA:  A:Let's think of three different strategies for this question.
