To do this, we perform 2 pounds * 3 brownies = 6 pounds of brownies. To do this, we perform 2 pounds * 2 brownies = 4 pounds of brownies. Then, we perform 2 pounds * 2 jelly beans = 4 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, we perform 2 pounds * 2 gummy worms = 4 pounds of gummy worms. We perform 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds of gummy worms. So the final answer is 8.\nThe brownies weighed 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. The jelly beans weighed 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. The gummy worms weighed 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. So, the total weight of the box was 2 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 pounds. The final answer: 12.\nThe brownies caused the weight of the box to triple, resulting in a weight of 3 * 2 = 6 pounds. The gummy worms caused the weight to double, resulting in a weight of 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. The gummy worms also doubled the weight of the box, resulting in a final weight of 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. The final answer: 8.\nFirst, we need to determine how many pounds of brownies Ken added to the box. We start by performing 2 * 3 = 6 pounds of brownies. Then, we perform 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of jelly beans. Next, we perform 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of gummy worms. Finally, we perform 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of gummy worms. The final answer: 8.\nThe brownies made the box weigh 3 * 2 = 4 pounds. The jelly beans made the box 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. The gummy worms made the box 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.

There were 277 / 2 = 127 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years. The answer: 127.\nSince ships have been built larger over time, each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, so each new ship had 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 4 * 847 = 2574 people. The monster ate 847 people in the first hundred years, so the ship had to have been on the water for 2574 / 100 = 12 ships. The answer: 1274.\nThe monster has eaten 847 people over 3 hundred years, so it must have eaten 847 * 3 = 3143 people in the first hundred years. The monster has only been able to rise once in a hundred years, so the ship must have had 3143 people on it in the first hundred years. The answer: 3143.\nSince each new ship has twice as many people as the last, the first ship had 2 * 2 * 2 = 4 times as many people as the last ship. Since the monster has consumed 847 people, the first ship had 847 - 4 = 574 people. The answer: 574.\nLet X be the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years. The monster ate 847 people in the third hundred years, so it ate X + 847 / 100 = X + 2 * X + 2 * X + 2 * X = 847. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives X = 847 * 2 = 847 / 2 = 447. Dividing both sides by 4 gives X = 447 / 100 = 32 people.

Mr. Benson received a 5 / 100 x 12 = $5 discount for each ticket bought that exceeds 10. So, Mr. Benson paid 40 x 5 = $35 for each ticket. Thus, Mr. Benson paid 40 x 15 = $70 for all tickets. The final answer: 70.\nMr. Benson paid 12 * 40 = $600 for the concert tickets. He received a 5% discount, so he paid 60 * .05 = $30 less for each ticket. So he paid 60 - 30 = $70 for the concert tickets. So in all Mr. Benson paid a total of 760 + 70 = $900. The answer: 900.\nMr. Benson paid 12 * 40 = $600 for the concert tickets. He received a discount of 5 / 100 * 6 = $2. So he paid 6 * 40 = $380. The final answer: 380.\nMr. Benson received a 5% discount, which means he paid 12 * 0.05 = $5 discount on his tickets. So, he paid 12 * 40 = $480. So, the answer is 480.\nMr. Benson paid $40 x 12 = $480 for the tickets. He paid $480 x 5 / 100 = $22 for each ticket that he bought. So he paid $22 x 10 = $240 for all the tickets. So Mr. Benson paid a total of $80 + $240 = $168 for the tickets.

The remaining 6 piles had a total of 6 * 12 = 108 bananas. There were 54 + 108 = 180 bananas in the 10 piles. Each monkey would get 180 / 12 = 15 bananas. The answer: 15.\nSince each hand had 14 bananas, the total number of bananas in 6 piles is 6 * 9 = 84 bananas. The total number of bananas in the remaining piles is 10 - 6 = 4 piles. Each hand in the 4 remaining piles had 9 bananas, meaning the total number of bananas in those piles is 84 + 9 = 85 bananas. Together, the 6 piles and the 4 remaining piles had 84 + 85 = 190 bananas. If they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 190 / 12 = 9 bananas. The answer: 9.\nThe first 6 piles had a total of 6 * 9 * 14 = 690 bananas. The remaining 4 piles had a total of 4 * 12 * 9 = 48 bananas. The total number of bananas collected is 690 + 48 = 6120 bananas. If they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 6120 / 12 = 216 bananas. The answer: 216.\nThere are a total of 6 piles * 9 hands / hand = 63 hands with 14 bananas. The total number of hands is 63 hands + 6 hands = 69 hands. There are a total of 10 piles * 12 hands / hand = 120 hands with 9 bananas. The total number of bananas is 120 hands + 69 hands = 224 bananas. There are a total of 12 monkeys * 224 bananas = 480 bananas. If they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 480 bananas / 12 monkeys = 4 bananas per monkey. The answer: 4.\nFirst find the total number of bananas in the 6 piles: 6 piles * 9 hands / hand = 54 bananas. Then find the total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles: 4 piles * 12 hands / hand = 48 bananas. Then add the number of bananas from the 6 piles and the 48 bananas from the other piles to find the total number of bananas: 54 bananas + 48 bananas = 126 bananas. Then divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find how many bananas each monkey gets: 126 bananas / 12 monkeys = 5 bananas / monkey.

After the second earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed increased by 8 x 2 = 16 buildings. After the third earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 16 x 2 = 32 buildings. After the fourth earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 32 x 2 = 64 buildings. After the fifth earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 64 x 2 = 128 buildings. After the sixth earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 128 x 2 = 256 buildings. The total number of buildings that collapsed is 4 + 8 + 256 + 128 = 372 buildings. The answer: 372.\nEach subsequent earthquake would cause double the number of buildings to collapse, so in the first earthquake, there were 4 * 2 = 8 buildings that collapsed. In the second earthquake, there were 2 * 8 = 16 buildings that collapsed. And in the third earthquake, there were 2 * 16 = 32 buildings that collapsed. Altogether, there were 4 + 8 + 32 = 64 buildings that collapsed. The answer: 64.\nThe first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse. Each subsequent earthquake had double the number of buildings collapsed so each earthquake had 2 * 4 = 8 buildings collapsed. The second earthquake had 8 * 2 = 16 buildings collapsed. The third earthquake had 16 * 2 = 32 buildings collapsed. The total number of buildings collapsed was 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 68. The answer: 68.\nSince each earthquake had double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, the second earthquake had 2 * 4 = 8 buildings collapse. The third earthquake had 2 * 8 = 16 buildings collapse. The fourth earthquake had 4 * 2 = 8 buildings collapse. So in total, 8 + 16 + 4 = 32 buildings collapsed. The answer: 32.\nAfter the first earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 4 buildings. In the second earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 2 * 4 = 8 buildings. In the third earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 2 * 2 = 4 buildings. In the fourth earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 4 * 2 = 8 buildings. In the fifth earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 8 * 2 = 16 buildings. In the sixth earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 16 * 2 = 32 buildings. So far, four buildings have collapsed in the first earthquake, and the number of buildings to collapse in the remaining two earthquakes will be 4 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 20 buildings.

So he spends 1000 - 65% = $450 on coursework materials. The answer: 450.\nFirst find how much James spends on food: $1000 x 30% = $300. Then find how much James spends on accommodation: $1000 x 15% = $150. Then find how much James spends on entertainment: $1000 x 25% = $250. Then subtract these three expenses from his budget to find how much he spends on coursework materials: $300 - $150 - $250 = $125. The answer: 125.\nFirst find how much James spends on food: 1000 * 30% = $300. Then find how much James spends on accommodation: 1000 * 15% = $150. Then find how much James spends on entertainment: 1000 * 25% = $250. Then subtract James's food, accommodation, and entertainment expenses from his budget to find how much he spends on coursework materials: 1000 - 300 - 150 - 250 = $250. The answer: 250.\nJames spends 30 + 15 + 25 = 75% of his budget on food, accommodation and entertainment. Therefore, James spends 1000 - 750 = $300 on coursework materials. The answer: 300.\nFirst, we need to calculate James' expenses. We start by calculating the percentage spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment. We find that 30% + 15% + 25% = 67% of his budget is spent on these three expenses. Then we multiply that percentage by the number of weeks in a semester to find how much he spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment. We find that 67% * 1000 = $5500 is spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment. We subtract the amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment to find the amount he spends on coursework materials: $5500 - 57% = $3000.

So the answer is 90000.\nAnswer:  90\nTarget:  448000\nOutput:  The first approach is to divide the total profit by 2 to find how much each partner got. Since Johnson got $2500, Mike got 2 / 5 * 2500 = $1500. After spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200, he will have $1000 - $200 = $900. The second approach involves multiplying Johnson's share by the ratio 2:5: 1500 * (2 + 5) = 3000. Mike will get 900 * 3 = $3000 after buying the shirt. Thus, the answer is 5000.\nAnswer:  3000\nTarget:  800\nOutput:  The important part for answering this question is: If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, then John must have taken away 6 - 4 = 2 green hard Hats. If John took away twice as many green as the number of pinks that he removed (i.e. 2 x 6 = 12 greens), then the total number that John removed from the truck is 2 * 12 = 24 green. In total, John and Carl removed a total of 4 + 2 = 8 pink, green, and yellow. Therefore, there remained 26 + 15 + 24 = 68 hard caps. The answer is .\nAnswer:  68\nTarget:  43\nOutput:  It takes Roque 2 * 3 = 6 hours a week to walk to and from work. He takes 6 * 2 = 12 hours to get to work by walking. And it takes him 1 * 1 = 1 hour to ride his bike. So in total, he takes 1 + 12 = 13 hours per week. The answer is 13.\nAnswer:  13\nTarget:  16\nOutput:  He bikes 20 miles back and forth for each of his 5 workdays so that's 20 * 2 = 40 miles per day. That means he bikes 40 * 5 = 200 miles a week. He also bikes 200 * 3 = 600 miles over the weekend. So in total Tim bikes 400 + 200 + 600 = 1200 miles. This means that in one week, Tim spends 1000 * 7 = 7200 minutes biking. The answer is 7000.\nAnswer:  7200\nTarget:  16\nOutput:  Bella bought 11 + 9 = 20 truck stamps. She bought 20 - 13 = 7 rose stamp. In total, she bought11 + 20 + 7 = 39 stamp cards.

The final answer: 18.\nAdding the jelly beans first, the weight of the box was 2 pounds. The brownies made the weight triple, which means the weight was 3 * 2 = 6 pounds. The brownies and jelly beans made the box 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 pounds. The gummy worms made the box double its original weight, so the weight was 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. The final weight of the box was 4 pounds. #### 4\nAdding the 2 pounds of jelly beans, the weight was 2 pounds + 2 pounds = 4 pounds.

The final weight was 4 pounds + 12 pounds + 8 pounds = 20 pounds. #### 20\nFirst, we need to determine the weight of the brownies. We do this by performing 2 * CALC(2 * brownies) + 2 * CALC(2 * jelly beans) = 4 pounds of brownies. Next, we need to determine the weight of the gummy worms. We do this by performing 2 * CALC(2 * gummy worms) + 2 * gummy worms = 4 pounds of gummy worms. We then multiply the weight of the brownies by 2 * 3 = 9 pounds.

The answer: 360.\nFirst find how many snakes are eaten per day: 5 snakes / jaguar * 6 jaguars = 30 snakes / day. Then find how many birds are eaten per day: 30 snakes / day * 3 birds / snake = 90 birds / day.

Bobbie’s last name is 2 * J = 2 J’s. Samantha’s last name is 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 2 - 3 = 1 J. Since Jamie’s last name is J, then Bobbie’s last name is 2 J * 2 = 4 J. Since Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, then it is 2 J * 4 = 8 J. Adding two letters to Bobbie’s last name, we get 2J + 2J = 4J. Subtracting two letters from Bobbie’s last name\nLet X be the number of letters in Samantha’s last name. Bobbie’s last name has 2 letters less than Jamie’s. So Bobbie’s last name is 2 * X + 2 * X + 2 * X = 2X + 2X + 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X = 2X = 2X = 2X = 4X. Hence, Samantha’s last name has 2X = 2X = 4 letters. Hence, the answer is\nIf Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s, so her last name would be 2 * Jamie’s = 2 letters long. If Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, then Bobbie’s last name has 2 + 3 = 5 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, then Bobbie’s last name has 5 + 2 = 7 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, then Bobbie’s last name has 7 + 3 = 12 letters. The answer is 12.\nIf Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s, meaning she would have 2 * Jamie’s = 4 letters in her last name. Since Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s, she has 4 - 3 = 1 letter in her last name. The answer is 1.\nLet J be the length of Jamie’s last name. Bobbie’s last name is 2 * J. Samantha’s last name is 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so she has 2 - 3 = 1 letter in her last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s, so J + 2 * J + 2 = 2 * J + 2 = 4 letters.

The fifth house must therefore have 20 - 12 = 4 gnomes. #### 4\nThere are a total of 4 + 5 = 9 gnomes in the first four houses. So, the fifth house must have 20 - 9 = 7 gnomes. #### 7\nSince there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, the fifth house must have 20 - 4 = 14 gnomes.

She was recently paid $600 more than she used to be paid so her salary is now $600 + X = $1200. Now her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her monthly income so X = 25% x 25% x 25% x X = $1200. X = 1200 / 25% = $480. X = $480 / 40% = $120. X = $800. The answer is .\nAfter her salary increase, Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income, which is 25% * $1600 = $4400. Hence, her previous monthly income was $4400 - $600 = $3000. #### 300\nBefore her salary increase, Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income so now they amount to 25% * 100 = 25 / 100. Her current income is $600 more than her previous income so her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income - $600 = 25% of her income. Since 25% is equal to 100, then Mrs. Snyder's previous income was $600 / 25 = $60. #### 60\nSince her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income, her new monthly income is X which is 25% of X. Since 40% of X is 40 / 100, her previous monthly income is X / 40 = X / 40. #### 40\nBefore her salary increase, Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities accounted for 25% of her income so her rent and utilities amount to 25% * 25% = $10. Her income was now $1000 so her rent and utilities amount to 25% * $1000 = $600.

Including the buildings from the first earthquake, there were 20 + 4 = 26 buildings that collapsed. #### 26\nAfter the first earthquake, there were 4 + 3 = 7 buildings that collapsed. Each subsequent earthquake had 2 * 4 = 8 buildings collapsed. After the second earthquake, there were 8 * 2 = 16 buildings collapsed. After the third earthquake, there were 16 * 2 = 32 buildings collapsed. After the fourth earthquake, there were 32 * 2 = 64 buildings collapsed. All together, there were 4 + 7 + 16 + 64 = 116 buildings that collapsed. #### 116\nThe number of buildings that collapsed after the second earthquake would be double the number that collapsed after the first earthquake, so the number of buildings that collapsed in the second earthquake would be 2 * 4 = 8. The number of buildings that collapsed in the third earthquake would be double the number that collapsed in the second earthquake, so the number of buildings that collapsed in the third earthquake would be 2 * 8 = 16. The total number of buildings that collapsed after all three earthquakes is 4 + 8 + 16 = 28. Including the buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake, 28 + 4 + 16 = 42 buildings had collapsed.

He spends 1000 * .775 = $250 on food, accommodation, and entertainment. He has 1000 - 250 = $500 left over after paying for all these expenses. He spends $500 * 1 / 3 = $250 on coursework materials. The answer is 250.\nHe spends 1000 * 30 / 100 = $300 on food. He spends 1000 * 15 / 100 = $150 on accommodation. He spends 1000 * 25 / 100 = $250 on entertainment. So, he spends 300 + 150 + 250 = $600 on non - coursework materials. Therefore, he spends 1000 - 600 = $200 on coursework materials. #### 200\nHe spends 30% + 15% + 25% = 67% of his budget on food, accommodation, and entertainment. That means he spends 1000 - 700 = $550 on coursework materials. #### 550\nFirst find the total amount of money James spends on food: $1000 x 30% = $300. Then find the total amount of money James spends on accommodation: $1000 x 15% = $150. Then find the total amount of money James spends on entertainment: $1000 x 25% = $250. Then subtract the total amount James spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment from the total amount he spends on coursework materials: $1000 - $300 - $150 - $250 = $150. The answer: 150\nHe spends 30% + 15% + 25% = 50% of his money on food, accommodation and entertainment. So he spends 1000 * 0.5 = $500 on food, accommodation and entertainment. He has 1000 - 500 = $500 left over for coursework materials.

Then find the total amount of time Carolyn spends practicing the piano: 20 minutes / day + 60 minutes / day = 80 minutes / day. Then add the two amounts to find her total amount of practice time: 80 minutes / day + 80 minutes / day = 240 minutes / week. Then multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks to find the monthly amount: 240 minutes / week * 4 weeks / month = 7200 minutes / month. The answer is 7200.\nFirst find how long Carolyn practices the piano: 20 minutes / day * 6 days / week = 120 minutes / week. Then find how long Carolyn practices the violin: 20 minutes / day * 3 = 60 minutes / day. Then add the two amounts of time to find the total amount of time she spends practicing: 120 minutes / week + 60 minutes / week = 180 minutes / week. Then multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks to find the monthly amount: 180 minutes / week * 4 weeks / month = 540 minutes / month. The answer is 540.\nShe spends 20 * 6 = 120 minutes a week practicing the piano. She spends 20 * 3 = 60 minutes a day practicing the violin. So, she spends 20 + 60 = 80 minutes a day practicing the violin. So, she spends 80 + 120 = 280 minutes a week practicing the piano and violin. Therefore, she spends 280 * 4 = 1120 minutes practicing in a month. #### 1120\nFirst find how long Carolyn practices the violin: 20 minutes / day * 3 = 60 minutes / day. Then add the two amounts of time to find the total amount of time she spends practicing: 60 minutes / day + 20 minutes / day = 80 minutes / day. Then multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks to find the total amount of time she spends practicing: 80 minutes / week * 6 weeks / week = 480 minutes / week. Then multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks to find the total amount of time she spends practicing: 480 minutes / week * 4 weeks / week = 2160 minutes / month. The answer is\nShe practices the violin for 20 * 3 = 60 minutes a day. So she practices the piano for 20 + 60 = 80 minutes a day. So she practices for 80 + 20 = 100 minutes a day. She practices for 100 * 6 = 600 minutes a week.

The monster has consumed 847 people in three hundred and one years, so it must have been on a ship that was twice as big as the last one. Each new ship has 2 * 2 = 4 times as many people as its predecessor. Thus, the ships have gotten larger over time, and each new one has twice the people of the previous one, meaning there were 4 * 1 = 2 people per ship. Therefore, if each ship had 2 times more people than the one before it, then the second ship would have had twice that number. So the third ship, which was the largest, had double that amount of passengers. Hence, there would be 2 x 4 = 8 * 8 = 16 * 16 = 32 * 32 = 64 * 64 = 128 * 96 = 512 people.

Since Mary was diagnosed with myopia, it can be concluded that she is most likely having trouble seeing things in the distance.
