First, we need to find out how many pounds of brownies were in the box. To do this, we perform 2 pounds * 3 brownies = 6 pounds of brownies. To do this, we perform 2 pounds * 2 brownies = 4 pounds of brownies. Then, we perform 2 pounds * 2 jelly beans = 4 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, we perform 2 pounds * 2 gummy worms = 4 pounds of gummy worms. We perform 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds of gummy worms. So the final answer is 8.
The brownies weighed 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. The jelly beans weighed 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. The gummy worms weighed 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. So, the total weight of the box was 2 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 pounds. The final answer: 12.
The brownies caused the weight of the box to triple, resulting in a weight of 3 * 2 = 6 pounds. The gummy worms caused the weight to double, resulting in a weight of 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. The gummy worms also doubled the weight of the box, resulting in a final weight of 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. The final answer: 8.
First, we need to determine how many pounds of brownies Ken added to the box. We start by performing 2 * 3 = 6 pounds of brownies. Then, we perform 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of jelly beans.

She works 10 hours a day for 5 days for a total of 10 * 5 = 50 hours. She makes $18.00 an hour for her overtime work, so she is paid $18 + 1 / 2 = $9.50 an hour. So her total earnings are 18 + 9 = $41.00. So the answer is 41.
She makes $18.00 an hour, so she makes $18 * 10 = $180.00. She works 10 hours a day, so she makes $180 * 10 = $180.00 per day. She works 5 days, so she makes 5 * 180 = $900.00. She is eligible for overtime, which means she makes overtime * $18 + 1 / 2 * $18 = $11.00. So she makes $18 + 1 / 2 * $11 = $18 + $11 = $28.00. The answer: 28.
She works 10 - 8 = 2 hours per day. She works 2 * 5 = 10 days. She makes $18.00 an hour. Overtime is paid by $18 + 1 / 2 * $18 = $8.00. She works 10 + 10 = 20 hours per day. Overtime is paid by $18 + 1 / 2 * $18 = $12.00. She works 20 * 5 = 100 hours. She makes $18.00 an hour. She makes $18.00 an hour. Overtime is paid by $18 + 1 / 2 * $18 = $6.00. She makes $18.00 an hour + $6.00 an hour = $42.00. The total amount she makes is $42.00 + $18.00 = $68.00. The answer: 68.
She works 10 hours a day for 5 days, so she makes 10 * 5 = 50 hours of overtime. She is paid overtime by her hourly wage + 1 / 2 * $18.00 = $90.00. She makes $180.00 an hour, so she makes 180 * 5 = $900 in overtime. She makes $900 for 5 days, so she makes 900 * 5 = $4500. The answer: 4500.
She works 10 hours every day for 5 days, so she makes 10 * 5 = 50 hours. She makes $18.00 an hour, so she makes $18 + 1 / 2 = $8.00 per hour.

The monster has eaten 847 / 3 = 277 people in the first hundred years. There were 277 / 2 = 127 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years. The answer: 127.
Since ships have been built larger over time, each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, so each new ship had 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 4 * 847 = 2574 people. The monster ate 847 people in the first hundred years, so the ship had to have been on the water for 2574 / 100 = 12 ships. The answer: 1274.
The monster has eaten 847 people over 3 hundred years, so it must have eaten 847 * 3 = 3143 people in the first hundred years. The monster has only been able to rise once in a hundred years, so the ship must have had 3143 people on it in the first hundred years. The answer: 3143.
Since each new ship has twice as many people as the last, the first ship had 2 * 2 * 2 = 4 times as many people as the last ship. Since the monster has consumed 847 people, the first ship had 847 - 4 = 574 people. The answer: 574.
Let X be the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years. The monster ate 847 people in the third hundred years, so it ate X + 847 / 100 = X + 2 * X + 2 * X + 2 * X = 847. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives X = 847 * 2 = 847 / 2 = 447. Dividing both sides by 4 gives X = 447 / 100 = 32 people. The answer: 32.

Since her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her monthly income now, then her previous monthly income was 25% of 25% * 100% = 25% of her previous monthly income. The answer: 25%.
The total amount of money Mrs. Snyder spent on rent and utilities is 40% * .4 = .8 of her monthly income. Her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income so now her rent and utilities amount to 25% * .8 = $16. Her previous monthly income was $16 x 12 = $62. The answer: 62.
After her salary increase, her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income, meaning they used to amount to 25% * .4 = 0.25 of her income. Her previous monthly income was 0.25 * (100 - .4) = 0.25 * (100 - $600) = $2000. The answer: 2000.
Let X be the previous monthly income of Mrs. Snyder. The rent and utilities amount to 40% of X. Since X is a multiple of 100, then X / 100 = X / 100. X = 100 / .40 = 0.25. Thus, X = 100 / 0.25 = $20. The final answer: 20.
First find how much Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities amount to now: 25% * income = .25 * income = $600. Then subtract this amount from her new income: $600 - $600 = $400. Then multiply her new monthly income by the percentage that her rent and utilities amount to now: $600 * .25 = $200. Then subtract her new monthly income from her previous monthly income to find the difference: $600 - $200 = $400. The final answer: 400.

Each pile had a total of 6 * 9 = 54 bananas. The remaining 6 piles had a total of 6 * 12 = 108 bananas. There were 54 + 108 = 180 bananas in the 10 piles. Each monkey would get 180 / 12 = 15 bananas. The answer: 15.
Since each hand had 14 bananas, the total number of bananas in 6 piles is 6 * 9 = 84 bananas. The total number of bananas in the remaining piles is 10 - 6 = 4 piles. Each hand in the 4 remaining piles had 9 bananas, meaning the total number of bananas in those piles is 84 + 9 = 85 bananas. Together, the 6 piles and the 4 remaining piles had 84 + 85 = 190 bananas. If they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 190 / 12 = 9 bananas. The answer: 9.
The first 6 piles had a total of 6 * 9 * 14 = 690 bananas. The remaining 4 piles had a total of 4 * 12 * 9 = 48 bananas. The total number of bananas collected is 690 + 48 = 6120 bananas. If they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 6120 / 12 = 216 bananas. The answer: 216.
There are a total of 6 piles * 9 hands / hand = 63 hands with 14 bananas. The total number of hands is 63 hands + 6 hands = 69 hands. There are a total of 10 piles * 12 hands / hand = 120 hands with 9 bananas. The total number of bananas is 120 hands + 69 hands = 224 bananas. There are a total of 12 monkeys * 224 bananas = 480 bananas. If they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 480 bananas / 12 monkeys = 4 bananas per monkey. The answer: 4.
First find the total number of bananas in the 6 piles: 6 piles * 9 hands / hand = 54 bananas. Then find the total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles: 4 piles * 12 hands / hand = 48 bananas. Then add the number of bananas from the 6 piles and the 48 bananas from the other piles to find the total number of bananas: 54 bananas + 48 bananas = 126 bananas. Then divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find how many bananas each monkey gets: 126 bananas / 12 monkeys = 5 bananas / monkey. The answer: 5.

After the first earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed increased by 4 x 2 = 8 buildings. After the second earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed increased by 8 x 2 = 16 buildings. After the third earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 16 x 2 = 32 buildings. After the fourth earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 32 x 2 = 64 buildings. After the fifth earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 64 x 2 = 128 buildings. After the sixth earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 128 x 2 = 256 buildings. The total number of buildings that collapsed is 4 + 8 + 256 + 128 = 372 buildings. The answer: 372.
Each subsequent earthquake would cause double the number of buildings to collapse, so in the first earthquake, there were 4 * 2 = 8 buildings that collapsed. In the second earthquake, there were 2 * 8 = 16 buildings that collapsed. And in the third earthquake, there were 2 * 16 = 32 buildings that collapsed. Altogether, there were 4 + 8 + 32 = 64 buildings that collapsed. The answer: 64.
The first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse. Each subsequent earthquake had double the number of buildings collapsed so each earthquake had 2 * 4 = 8 buildings collapsed. The second earthquake had 8 * 2 = 16 buildings collapsed. The third earthquake had 16 * 2 = 32 buildings collapsed. The total number of buildings collapsed was 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 68. The answer: 68.
Since each earthquake had double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, the second earthquake had 2 * 4 = 8 buildings collapse. The third earthquake had 2 * 8 = 16 buildings collapse. The fourth earthquake had 4 * 2 = 8 buildings collapse. So in total, 8 + 16 + 4 = 32 buildings collapsed. The answer: 32.
After the first earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 4 buildings. In the second earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 2 * 4 = 8 buildings. In the third earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 2 * 2 = 4 buildings. In the fourth earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 4 * 2 = 8 buildings. In the fifth earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 8 * 2 = 16 buildings. In the sixth earthquake, the number of buildings collapsed was 16 * 2 = 32 buildings. So far, four buildings have collapsed in the first earthquake, and the number of buildings to collapse in the remaining two earthquakes will be 4 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 20 buildings. The answer: 20.

First find how much James spends on food: $1000 x 30% = $300. Then find how much James spends on accommodation: $1000 x 15% = $150. Then find how much James spends on entertainment: $1000 x 25% = $250. Then subtract these three expenses from his budget to find how much he spends on coursework materials: $300 - $150 - $250 = $125. The answer: 125.
First find how much James spends on food: 1000 * 30% = $300. Then find how much James spends on accommodation: 1000 * 15% = $150. Then find how much James spends on entertainment: 1000 * 25% = $250. Then subtract James's food, accommodation, and entertainment expenses from his budget to find how much he spends on coursework materials: 1000 - 300 - 150 - 250 = $250. The answer: 250.
James spends 30 + 15 + 25 = 75% of his budget on food, accommodation and entertainment. Therefore, James spends 1000 - 750 = $300 on coursework materials. The answer: 300.
First, we need to calculate James' expenses. We start by calculating the percentage spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment. We find that 30% + 15% + 25% = 67% of his budget is spent on these three expenses. Then we multiply that percentage by the number of weeks in a semester to find how much he spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment. We find that 67% * 1000 = $5500 is spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment. We subtract the amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment to find the amount he spends on coursework materials: $5500 - 57% = $3000. The answer: 3000.

Adding the brownies to the box, the weight tripled, meaning the package weighed 3 * 2 = 6 pounds. The brownies added to the box increased the weight by 6 pounds, and so the package weighed 6 + 2 = 8 pounds. The gummy worms added to the box by 8 pounds, which increased the package's weight by 8 * 2 = 16 pounds. The package weighed 16 + 2 = 18 pounds. The final answer: 18.
Adding the jelly beans first, the weight of the box was 2 pounds. The brownies made the weight triple, which means the weight was 3 * 2 = 6 pounds. The brownies and jelly beans made the box 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 pounds. The gummy worms made the box double its original weight, so the weight was 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. The final weight of the box was 4 pounds. #### 4
Adding the 2 pounds of jelly beans, the weight was 2 pounds + 2 pounds = 4 pounds. The brownies tripled the weight, bringing the weight to 3 pounds * 3 = 9 pounds. Then, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the weight to 4 pounds + 2 pounds = 8 pounds. And lastly, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight, bringing the weight to 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. The final weight of the box of goodies was 4 pounds + 9 pounds + 8 pounds = 24 pounds. #### 24
Adding the jelly beans first, Ken's package weighed 2 pounds + 2 pounds = 4 pounds. After adding the brownies, the weight tripled, resulting in 4 pounds * 3 = 12 pounds. After adding the jelly beans, the weight doubled, resulting in 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds. After adding the gummy worms, the weight doubled, resulting in 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds. The final weight was 4 pounds + 12 pounds + 8 pounds = 20 pounds. #### 20
First, we need to determine the weight of the brownies. We do this by performing 2 * CALC(2 * brownies) + 2 * CALC(2 * jelly beans) = 4 pounds of brownies. Next, we need to determine the weight of the gummy worms. We do this by performing 2 * CALC(2 * gummy worms) + 2 * gummy worms = 4 pounds of gummy worms. We then multiply the weight of the brownies by 2 * 3 = 9 pounds. We then multiply the weight of the gummy worms by 2 * 2 = 4 pounds. We then add all the weights together,

She works 10 hours a day, so overtime is paid at $18 x 2 / 2 = $12.00. Overtime is paid for 10 * 5 = 50 hours. She makes $18 x 50 = $880.00 per week. She works 50 hours a week, so overtime is paid at $880 x 50 = $1,200.00. She makes $80 x 50 = $4,000 per week. She works 50 hours a week, so overtime is paid at 4000 x 50 = $1,600.00.

During the last hundred years, the ships have doubled in size, meaning each new ship has 2 * 2 = 4 people. Since the monster has consumed 847 people over three hundred years, the first hundred years had a total of 3 * 847 = 2587 people.

There are 6 * 5 = 30 snakes in the forest. There are 60 * 3 = 180 birds in the forest. There are 180 * 12 = 540 beetles eaten in the forest each day. The answer is 540.
There are 60 snakes because 6 x 5 = 60. There are 240 birds because 60 / 3 = 240. There are 480 beetles per day because 240 / 12 = 480. The answer is 480.
First find how many snakes are eaten: 5 snakes / jaguar * 6 jaguars = 30 snakes. Then find how many birds are eaten: 30 snakes / 3 birds / snake = 15 snakes. Then find how many beetles are eaten: 12 beetles / bird * 15 snakes = 360 beetles. The answer: 360.
First find how many snakes are eaten per day: 5 snakes / jaguar * 6 jaguars = 30 snakes / day. Then find how many birds are eaten per day: 30 snakes / day * 3 birds / snake = 90 birds / day. Then subtract the number of birds from the number of beetles to find the number of beetles eaten: 90 beetles / bird * 12 beetles / bird = 780 beetles. The answer is 780.
Each jaguar eats 5 / 5 = 0.5 birds per day. If there are 6 jaguars in the forest, then they eat 0.5 * 6 = 3 birds per day. Together, the jaguars and birds eat 0.5 + 3 = 7 birds per day. Since each bird eats 12 beetles per day, the total number of beetles eaten is 12 * 7 = 216 beetles per day. The answer is 216.

Let J be the number of letters in Jamie’s last name. Bobbie’s last name is 2 * J = 2 J’s. Samantha’s last name is 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so it is 2 - 3 = 1 J. Since Jamie’s last name is J, then Bobbie’s last name is 2 J * 2 = 4 J. Since Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, then it is 2 J * 4 = 8 J. Adding two letters to Bobbie’s last name, we get 2J + 2J = 4J. Subtracting two letters from Bobbie’s last name
Let X be the number of letters in Samantha’s last name. Bobbie’s last name has 2 letters less than Jamie’s. So Bobbie’s last name is 2 * X + 2 * X + 2 * X = 2X + 2X + 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X + 2X = 2X = 2X = 2X = 2X = 4X. Hence, Samantha’s last name has 2X = 2X = 4 letters. Hence, the answer is
If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s, so her last name would be 2 * Jamie’s = 2 letters long. If Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, then Bobbie’s last name has 2 + 3 = 5 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, then Bobbie’s last name has 5 + 2 = 7 letters. Since Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, then Bobbie’s last name has 7 + 3 = 12 letters. The answer is 12.
If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s, meaning she would have 2 * Jamie’s = 4 letters in her last name. Since Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s, she has 4 - 3 = 1 letter in her last name. The answer is 1.
Let J be the length of Jamie’s last name. Bobbie’s last name is 2 * J. Samantha’s last name is 3 fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name, so she has 2 - 3 = 1 letter in her last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s, so J + 2 * J + 2 = 2 * J + 2 = 4 letters. The length of Samantha’s last name is 1 - 3 = 2 letters. The answer is 2.

First find the total amount of salt in the seawater: 2 liters * 20% = 0.5 liters. Then find the volume of the seawater Jack collects: 2 liters * 2 liters = 4 liters. Then find the amount of salt Jack gets when all the water evaporates: 4 liters * 0.5 ml / liter = 200 ml. The answer is 200.
Jack will get 2 * 100 = 200 ml of salt when the water evaporates. The salt content of the water is 200 * 20 / 100 = 0.2 kg. So he will get 200 * 0.2 = 400 ml of salt. #### 400
First find the amount of salt in 1 liter of seawater: 2 liters * 20% = 0.2 liters. Then multiply the volume of the water by the salt content to find the total amount of salt in it: 2 liters * 20% = 0.2 liters. Then multiply the volume of salt by the amount of salt to find the amount Jack gets when all the water evaporates: 0.2 liters * 1000 ml / liter = 200 ml. The answer is 200.

If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, and each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden, there are a total of 4 * 3 = 12 gnomes in the first four houses. The fifth house must therefore have 20 - 12 = 4 gnomes. #### 4
There are a total of 4 + 5 = 9 gnomes in the first four houses. So, the fifth house must have 20 - 9 = 7 gnomes. #### 7
Since there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, the fifth house must have 20 - 4 = 14 gnomes. Since each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden, the fifth house must have 14 / 3 = 4 gnomes. The answer is 4.
If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, the first four houses have a total of 20 / 4 = 5 gnomes. The fifth house has a total of 5 gnomes + 5 gnomes = 10 gnomes. The answer is 10.
Since each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden, the fifth house has a total of 4 * 3 = 12 gnomes. Since there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, the fifth house has 20 - 12 = 4 gnomes. #### 4

Let X be the previous monthly income of Mrs. Snyder. She was recently paid $600 more than she used to be paid so her salary is now $600 + X = $1200. Now her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her monthly income so X = 25% x 25% x 25% x X = $1200. X = 1200 / 25% = $480. X = $480 / 40% = $120. X = $800. The answer is .
After her salary increase, Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income, which is 25% * $1600 = $4400. Hence, her previous monthly income was $4400 - $600 = $3000. #### 300
Before her salary increase, Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income so now they amount to 25% * 100 = 25 / 100. Her current income is $600 more than her previous income so her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income - $600 = 25% of her income. Since 25% is equal to 100, then Mrs. Snyder's previous income was $600 / 25 = $60. #### 60
Since her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her income, her new monthly income is X which is 25% of X. Since 40% of X is 40 / 100, her previous monthly income is X / 40 = X / 40. #### 40
Before her salary increase, Mrs. Snyder's rent and utilities accounted for 25% of her income so her rent and utilities amount to 25% * 25% = $10. Her income was now $1000 so her rent and utilities amount to 25% * $1000 = $600. Since her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of her income, her previous income was $1000 - $600 = $400. #### 400

Bill and Dale eat 4 * 2 = 8 pizza pieces. Ann and Cate eat 4 * .75 = 2 pizza pieces. So, together they eat 8 + 2 = 12 pizza pieces. Therefore, 12 - 8 = 4 pizza pieces are uneaten. #### 4
First find the total number of pizza pieces: 4 pieces / person * 4 people = 16 pieces. Then find the total number of pizza pieces Bill and Dale eat: 16 pieces / person * 50% = 8 pieces. Then find the total number of pizza pieces Ann and Cate eat: 16 pieces / person * 75% = 42 pieces. Then subtract the total number of pieces Bill and Dale eat from the total number of pieces to find the difference: 16 pieces - 8 pieces = 12 pieces. Then subtract the total number of pieces Ann and Cate eat from the total number of pieces to find the difference: 12 pieces - 42 pieces = 8 pieces. The answer is
Bill and Dale eat 4 x 50 / 100 = 2 pizzas. Bill and Dale eat 2 * 4 = 8 pizzas. Ann and Cate eat 4 x 75 / 100 = 7 pizzas. The total pizzas eaten is 2 + 8 + 7 = 13. The total number of uneaten pizza pieces is 13 - 8 = 4. #### 4
If Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas, then Bill and Dale eat 4 * 2 = 8 pizza pieces. Together, Bill and Dale eat 8 * 2 = 16 pizza pieces. Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas, so they eat 75% * 16 = 84 pizza pieces. Together, Ann and Cate eat 84 * 2 = 176 pizza pieces. In total, Bill and Dale eat 16 + 176 = 280 pizza pieces. Together, Ann and Cate eat 184 * 2 = 324 pizza pieces. 280 - 280 = 128 pizza pieces are uneaten. #### 128
Each pizza has 4 pieces, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 pizza pieces. Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas, so they eat 0.5 * 16 = 8 pizza pieces. Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas, so they eat 7.5 * 16 = 36 pizza pieces. Together, they eat 8 + 36 = 48 pizza pieces. Since there were 16 pizza pieces, then 48 - 16 = 32 pizza pieces are uneaten. #### 32

Noah sold 8 * $60 = $600 in large paintings last month. He sold 4 * $30 = $120 in small paintings last month. So he sold a total of $600 + $120 = $180 last month. This month he sold twice as much so he sold 2 * $180 = $280. #### 280
Noah sold 8 x $60 = $800 large paintings. He sold 4 x $30 = $80 small paintings. So he sold a total of $800 + $80 = $1200 last month. So this month he sold 2 * $1200 = $2400. So his sales for this month are $2400 + $1200 = $3600. #### 3600
Noah sold 8 large paintings for $60 each so he made 8 * 60 = $480. He sold 4 small paintings for $30 each so he made 4 * 30 = $120. In total he sold for this month 8 large paintings + 4 small paintings for a total of 8 + 120 = $240. If he sold twice as much this month, his sales for this month is 2 * 240 = 480. The answer is 480.
Noah sold 8 * 60 = 480 large paintings last month. He sold 4 * 30 = 120 small paintings last month. So he sold 480 + 120 = 560 last month. So his sales for this month is 560 * 2 = 1200. The answer is 1200.

Let x be the distance that the car had to travel after the 3rd turn. Then, 23 - x = x + x + x + x + x = 23. x = 10 meters. x = 5 meters. x = 8 meters. x = 13 meters. x = 4 meters. x = 4 meters. x = 5 meters. x = 8 meters. x = 8 meters. x = 5 meters. x = 8 meters. x = 5 meters. x = 5 meters. x = 8 meters. x = 8 meters. x = 5 meters. x = 5 meters. x
Let x be the distance the car had to travel after the 3rd turn. Then x + 3x + 5x = 23. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives: x + 3x + 5x = 23. Adding the two sides gives: x + 3x = 23. Dividing both sides by 3 gives: x = 5. #### 5
#### 5 + 8 = 13 meters after the first two turns. #### 13 - 5 = 8 meters after the second turn. #### 8 - 5 = 3 meters after the third turn. #### 3
After the 2nd turn, the car had to travel 8 + 5 = 15 meters. The car has traveled a total of 23 + 15 = 45 meters. So, it had to travel 45 - 15 = 15 meters after the 3rd turn. #### 15
#### 23 - 5 - 8 = 11 meters. After the 1st turn, the car traveled 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it traveled 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it traveled 11 meters. So the total distance the car has traveled in the tunnel is 23 + 11 = 32 meters. So after the 3rd turn, the car had to travel 32 - 3 = 23 meters. #### 23

1/ 2 * 16 = 8 teaspoons of salt. The total number of teaspoons of salt Kimber needs is 8 * 1 / 2 = 4 teaspoons. Together, Kimber needs 10 + 16 + 4 = 28 cups of water, flour, and salt. #### 28
1/0.5 * 16 = 8 teaspoons of salt. Kimber needs 8 * 16 = 128 teaspoons of salt to make a pizza. Together with the water, she needs 10 + 16 + 128 = 168 cups of water, flour, and salt. #### 168
1/ 1 * 16 = 4 cups of flour. 1 / 2 * 16 = 4 cups of salt. 16 + 4 = 20 cups of water, flour, and salt. #### 20
1/ 1 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour, which is 16 cups, is 16 * 0.5 = 8 teaspoons. The total number of teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs is 8 * 0.5 = 4 teaspoons. The total number of cups of water, flour, and salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is 10 + 16 + 4 = 32. #### 32

Let B be the number of students in Grade 5 who got a final grade of B and above. 40% * 60 students = 40 / 100 * 60 students = 24 students got a final grade below B. Hence, 60 students - 24 students = 36 students got a final grade of B and above. #### 36
First find how many students got a final grade below B: 40 / 100 * 60 students = 24 students. Then subtract that number from the number of students who got a final grade of B and above to find the number of students who got a final grade of B or above: 60 students - 24 students = 36 students.

If each pile had 9 hands, with each hand having 14 bananas, there were a total of 6 * 9 * 14 = 336 bananas in the 6 piles. The total number of bananas in the remaining piles was 12 * 12 * 9 = 720 bananas. The total number of bananas in the 10 piles is 336 + 720 = 736 bananas. The total number of bananas in the family of 12 monkeys is 12 * 736 = 772 bananas. If they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 772 / 12 = 22 bananas. The answer is 22.
There are a total of 6 * 9 * 14 = 336 bananas from the 6 piles of hands with 9 hands. There are a total of 10 * 12 * 9 = 540 bananas from the 6 piles of hands with 12 hands. The total number of bananas is 336 + 540 = 824 bananas. If they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey would get 824 / 12 = 84 bananas. #### 84
In the 6 piles of hands that had 9 hands, there were 9 * 14 = 168 bananas. There were also 12 * 9 = 216 bananas in the remaining piles of hands that had 12 hands. Together, the 6 piles of hands and the remaining piles of hands had 168 + 216 = 416 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is 416 + 168 = 460 bananas. If the family of monkeys splits the bananas equally amongst themselves, each monkey will receive 460 / 12 = 3 bananas. #### 3
First find the total number of bananas in the 6 piles: 6 piles * 14 bananas / hand = 84 bananas. Then find the total number of bananas in the remaining piles: 10 piles - 6 piles = 4 piles. Then multiply the number of bananas per hand by the number of hands per pile to find the total number of bananas: 84 bananas * 4 hands / pile = 984 bananas. Then subtract the total number of bananas from the total number to find the number of bananas per monkey: 984 bananas / 12 monkeys = 728 bananas. Then multiply the number of monkeys by the number
The first 6 piles had 6 * 9 = 54 bananas. So there were 54 * 6 = 336 bananas from the first 6 piles. The remaining 2 piles had 2 * 12 = 24 bananas. So there were 24 * 2 = 48 bananas from the remaining piles. Therefore, the total number of bananas was 336 + 48 = 372 bananas. There are 12 monkeys in the family, so each monkey would get 372 / 12 = 9 bananas. #### 9

First find the number of buildings collapsed in the second earthquake: 4 buildings * 2 = 8 buildings. Then find the number of buildings collapsed in the third earthquake: 8 buildings * 2 = 16 buildings. Then add the number of buildings collapsed in the first earthquake to find the total number: 4 buildings + 8 buildings + 16 buildings = 32 buildings. #### 32
After the first earthquake, the number of buildings that collapsed was 4 buildings. The second earthquake had double the number of buildings that collapsed, meaning there were 2 * 4 = 8 buildings that collapsed. The third earthquake had double the number of buildings that collapsed, meaning there were 2 * 2 = 4 buildings that collapsed. The fourth earthquake had double the number of buildings that collapsed, meaning there were 2 * 4 = 8 buildings that collapsed. The total number of buildings that collapsed after all three earthquakes was 4 + 8 + 4 = 22 buildings. Including the four buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake, 22 + 4 = 30 buildings had collapsed. #### 30
After the first earthquake, there were 4 + 2 = 6 buildings that collapsed. After the second earthquake, there were 2 * 6 = 12 buildings that collapsed. After the third earthquake, there were 2 * 2 = 4 buildings that collapsed. There were a total of 4 + 12 + 4 = 20 buildings that collapsed. Including the buildings from the first earthquake, there were 20 + 4 = 26 buildings that collapsed. #### 26
After the first earthquake, there were 4 + 3 = 7 buildings that collapsed. Each subsequent earthquake had 2 * 4 = 8 buildings collapsed. After the second earthquake, there were 8 * 2 = 16 buildings collapsed. After the third earthquake, there were 16 * 2 = 32 buildings collapsed. After the fourth earthquake, there were 32 * 2 = 64 buildings collapsed. All together, there were 4 + 7 + 16 + 64 = 116 buildings that collapsed. #### 116
The number of buildings that collapsed after the second earthquake would be double the number that collapsed after the first earthquake, so the number of buildings that collapsed in the second earthquake would be 2 * 4 = 8. The number of buildings that collapsed in the third earthquake would be double the number that collapsed in the second earthquake, so the number of buildings that collapsed in the third earthquake would be 2 * 8 = 16. The total number of buildings that collapsed after all three earthquakes is 4 + 8 + 16 = 28. Including the buildings that collapsed in the first earthquake, 28 + 4 + 16 = 42 buildings had collapsed. The answer is 42.

James spends 30 + 15 + 25 = 75% of his budget on food, accommodation, and entertainment. He spends 1000 * .775 = $250 on food, accommodation, and entertainment. He has 1000 - 250 = $500 left over after paying for all these expenses. He spends $500 * 1 / 3 = $250 on coursework materials. The answer is 250.
He spends 1000 * 30 / 100 = $300 on food. He spends 1000 * 15 / 100 = $150 on accommodation. He spends 1000 * 25 / 100 = $250 on entertainment. So, he spends 300 + 150 + 250 = $600 on non - coursework materials. Therefore, he spends 1000 - 600 = $200 on coursework materials. #### 200
He spends 30% + 15% + 25% = 67% of his budget on food, accommodation, and entertainment. That means he spends 1000 - 700 = $550 on coursework materials. #### 550
First find the total amount of money James spends on food: $1000 x 30% = $300. Then find the total amount of money James spends on accommodation: $1000 x 15% = $150. Then find the total amount of money James spends on entertainment: $1000 x 25% = $250. Then subtract the total amount James spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment from the total amount he spends on coursework materials: $1000 - $300 - $150 - $250 = $150. The answer: 150
He spends 30% + 15% + 25% = 50% of his money on food, accommodation and entertainment. So he spends 1000 * 0.5 = $500 on food, accommodation and entertainment. He has 1000 - 500 = $500 left over for coursework materials. The answer is 500.

First find the total amount of time Carolyn spends practicing the violin: 20 minutes / day * 3 = 60 minutes / day. Then find the total amount of time Carolyn spends practicing the piano: 20 minutes / day + 60 minutes / day = 80 minutes / day. Then add the two amounts to find her total amount of practice time: 80 minutes / day + 80 minutes / day = 240 minutes / week. Then multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks to find the monthly amount: 240 minutes / week * 4 weeks / month = 7200 minutes / month. The answer is 7200.
First find how long Carolyn practices the piano: 20 minutes / day * 6 days / week = 120 minutes / week. Then find how long Carolyn practices the violin: 20 minutes / day * 3 = 60 minutes / day. Then add the two amounts of time to find the total amount of time she spends practicing: 120 minutes / week + 60 minutes / week = 180 minutes / week. Then multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks to find the monthly amount: 180 minutes / week * 4 weeks / month = 540 minutes / month. The answer is 540.
She spends 20 * 6 = 120 minutes a week practicing the piano. She spends 20 * 3 = 60 minutes a day practicing the violin. So, she spends 20 + 60 = 80 minutes a day practicing the violin. So, she spends 80 + 120 = 280 minutes a week practicing the piano and violin. Therefore, she spends 280 * 4 = 1120 minutes practicing in a month. #### 1120
First find how long Carolyn practices the violin: 20 minutes / day * 3 = 60 minutes / day. Then add the two amounts of time to find the total amount of time she spends practicing: 60 minutes / day + 20 minutes / day = 80 minutes / day. Then multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks to find the total amount of time she spends practicing: 80 minutes / week * 6 weeks / week = 480 minutes / week. Then multiply the weekly amount by the number of weeks to find the total amount of time she spends practicing: 480 minutes / week * 4 weeks / week = 2160 minutes / month. The answer is
She practices the violin for 20 * 3 = 60 minutes a day. So she practices the piano for 20 + 60 = 80 minutes a day. So she practices for 80 + 20 = 100 minutes a day. She practices for 100 * 6 = 600 minutes a week. So she practices for 600 * 4 = 2400 minutes a month. #### 2400

The monster has consumed 847 people in three hundred and one years, so it must have been on a ship that was twice as big as the last one. Each new ship has 2 * 2 = 4 times as many people as its predecessor. Thus, the ships have gotten larger over time, and each new one has twice the people of the previous one, meaning there were 4 * 1 = 2 people per ship. Therefore, if each ship had 2 times more people than the one before it, then the second ship would have had twice that number. So the third ship, which was the largest, had double that amount of passengers. Hence, there would be 2 x 4 = 8 * 8 = 16 * 16 = 32 * 32 = 64 * 64 = 128 * 96 = 512 people.

Output:  Thought 1: She practices the piano for 20 minutes a day and the violin for three times as long, so she practices 20 * 3 = 60 minutes per day. The total time she spends practicing each day is 20 + 60 = 80 minutes. Since there are four weeks in one month, she practiced for 4 * 80 = 480 minutes each week. Thus, the total number of minutes she spent practicing per week is 80 * 4 = 360. Therefore, her total practice time per month is 360 + 360 = 880 minutes, which is the same as her weekly practice. She spent 840 minutes practicing in four months, or 8280 / 4 weeks = 2160 minutes total. There is no way to know the final answer without solving the problem.
